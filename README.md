## Editing and Adding your Own System Menu's


</div>

### Description

this lets you edit the system menu on your form. you can make it perform functions also. the only downside to this is that the form is not movable by titlebar. i've seen other codes posted on this but the one i was looking at didn't show how to perform commands on click. anyways hope this helps you out.
